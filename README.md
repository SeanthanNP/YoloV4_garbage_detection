# Garbage Detection using YOLOv4

This repository contains the code to detect four types of garbage—`plastic_bottle`, `plastic_bag`, `styrofoam`, and `aluminum_can`—using the YOLOv4 object detection model. The project aims to automate waste detection to aid in garbage collection and recycling processes, helping reduce human exposure to hazardous materials and streamline waste management.

## Features

- Real-time detection of four types of garbage: `plastic_bottle`, `plastic_bag`, `styrofoam`, and `aluminum_can`.
- Efficient detection using the YOLOv4 model for improved speed and accuracy.
- Custom-trained YOLOv4 model on a dataset specific to garbage detection.
- Ready-to-deploy for surveillance systems or autonomous robots.
